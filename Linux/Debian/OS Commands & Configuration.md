## Setup and Configuration
### Change Resolution
Note: in Hypervisors such as Hyper-V, the resolution of the Virtual machine may be lower than your screens discplay, we can increase / decrease with the following processes.

First, open the grub config file then search: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
```terminal
$ sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
You can change the resolution to your requirements.
- Fullscreen : 1920x1080
- Windowed : 1680x1050

Make the following changes, save and close the file.
```nano
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080"
```
update Grub and restart
```
sudo update-grub
sudo reboot
```
If your Hyper-V virtual machine failed to load, you may need to restart the virtual machine.
